        The key to my motivation is <i><b>User Satisfaction</b></i>. If I can make someone's life better than I have got my job done. As a software engineer, I enjoy using my attention to detail, my love for building things from scratch, and my `Impact-driven` mission to literally make the world a better place to live.

        <br />
        When I am not in front of the computer, I focus on enhancing my
        motivational public speaking skills by speaking at a Toastmaster's
        club at Cerner.
